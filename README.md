# Procedural Atmosphere

This is a course project made at Link√∂ping University for the course TNM084 - Procedural Methods for Images.

### Idea

The aim of this project was to create a rendering of an atmosphere, using Rayleigh- and Mie scattering.
A procedural landscape (generated with Simplex Noise) was also added to the scene and the user can interact with all objects in the scene via multiple settings in a simple GUI. 

The rendering is done in real-time on browsers with WebGL. The user can navigate around with the arrow keys and look around with the mouse. 

There are a lot of possible future developments that I'll hopefully will play around with in the next couple of months. It would for example be interesting to add procedural clouds, fog, shadows, ambient occlusion, participating media and other effects to the landscape. The landscape generation may also be in need of a face-lift to allow for a more mountain-like landscape!
