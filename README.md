# Procedural Atmosphere

This is a course project made at Link√∂ping University for the course TNM084 - Procedural Images.

### Idea

The aim of this project is to create a procedural rendering of an atmosphere, using Rayleigh scattering.
If time allows Mie-scattering for rendering fog will also be implemented. 

Preferably the rendering will be performed in real-time and in WebGL. Hopefully the user can walk/fly around at ground level and se the sun rise and set.
Maybe even render some procedural environment with mountains, clouds and/or other generic procedural generated terrain. 
It would be fun to have some interactive controls for time, how to generate the landscape and to change the density of the atmosphere for example.
